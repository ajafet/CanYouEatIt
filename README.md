# CanYouEatIt

Can You Eat It is a mobile application for both iOS and Android that scans the barcode of a food item and notifies the user of possible allergens in the item. Users who suffer from food allergens will no longer have to read long lists of ingredients to determine if they can eat the food item, simply scanning its barcode can reveal to the user the allergens. Can You Eat It allows users to: 

* Save their allergens for future scans 
* Scan food item barcodes to detect users allergens 
* Displays a description and ingredients after scanning 

### Functionality 

Can You Eat It consits of a primary page that asks for the users name and their allergens. After the user inputs their information, a second page is shown with a camera icon. Pressing the camera icon will open their camera to scan a barcode. Once the camera detects a valid barcode, an alert dialog is shown with the foods description, ingredients and allergens found.
