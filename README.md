# CanYouEatIt

Can You Eat It is a mobile application for both iOS and Android that scans the barcode of a food item and notifies the user of possible allergens in the item. Users who suffer from allergens will no longer have to scan long lists of ingredients to determine if they can eat the food item, simply scanning its barcode can reveal to the user the allergens. Can You Eat It allows users to: 

* Save their allergens for future scans 
* Scan food item barcodes to detect users allergens 
* Displays a description and ingredients after scanning
